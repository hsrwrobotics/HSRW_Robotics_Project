## JRC-AUTOTRAC 2020: A small-scale automated vehicles competition 
The JRC-AUTOTRAC 2020 is a competition for teams of makers who will compete against each other with self-built fleets of small-scale automated vehicles. After postponing it twice due to the effects of the Covid pandemics, the final event of the competition was held in the form of an online event on 17 June 2021 as part of the 7th International IEEE Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems.

## Teams
The plan at first is that there would be 12 teams competing together in the physical events in April 2020 at Ispra, Italy. However due to the effects of the Covid pandemic, the competition was postponed for the first time in March 2020, and later was converted to a remote event. 

At the time of the final event hosted on June 2021, there are only three international teams left, which are:
- [Technical University of Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/)
- [University of California Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/)
- [Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences (HSRW-Hammy)](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/en) 

## Regulations

Each team will show the performance of their in-house developed fleet of four small-scale automated vehicles on the <a href="#tracks">two different traffic scenarios</a> prepared for the race, including _High-way scenario and Urban Scenario_.

During the performance of their vehicles the teams will earn or loose points. The team collecting the highest number of points among the two scenarios will win the competition.

## Our performances

Our self-driving vehicles were developed based on the idea of a heterogeneous system which consist of two different single-board computers: Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi 4. The vehicles is required to perform the following tasks:
- Obstacle detection
- Sign detection
- Autonomous Parking
- Lane Navigation
- Communication
